Ayush Kanoje – Linux Journey for Cloud Computing

Start Date: 20th October 2025

This marks the beginning of my Linux journey with a clear goal: mastering Linux to become proficient in Cloud Computing and Cloud Security.
Linux is the foundation of most cloud platforms, and understanding it deeply will empower me to deploy, manage, and secure cloud environments
effectively.

Goals for this journey:
- Master Linux commands, file systems, permissions, and process management.
- Learn shell scripting and automation for cloud tasks.
- Understand server setup, networking, and virtualization.
- Gain practical skills to work with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Prepare for cloud security challenges and best practices.

Every command I execute, every server I configure, and every script I write brings me closer to my goal: becoming a skilled Cloud Engineer with strong Linux expertise.  
This file will document my progress, lessons learned, and milestones achieved along the way.

“Linux is the gateway to the cloud. Master it, and the cloud becomes yours.”
